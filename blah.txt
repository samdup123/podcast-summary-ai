“And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, ‘Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you?’ But he remained silent and made no answer. Again, the high priest asked him, ‘Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed?’ And Jesus said, ‘I am and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of power and coming with the clouds of heaven.’” —Mark 14:60-62

Go now in grace and peace.
